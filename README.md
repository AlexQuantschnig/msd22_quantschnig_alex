# Math-Game

This is a java program where you get 7 math assignments. Each assignment is tracking the time needed to complete it. All assignments are printed on the console after all 7 are completed.

## Installation

To run the java program you have to make sure you have at least the Java SE 19 installed on your device.

- If you have not installed it you can download it from the [oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk19-archive-downloads.html).
- To view how to install the jdk on your device, you can visit the [installation instruction](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/20/install/overview-jdk-installation.html#GUID-8677A77F-231A-40F7-98B9-1FD0B48C346A) from oracle.

## Run

You can either run the program inside an IDE of your prefered choice or just simple run it inside your terminal.
To run the program inside your terminal use the following commands:

- javac Mathgame.java
- java Mathgame

If everything is correctly installed you should now see the start of the program in your terminal.
It should look like this:

```cmd
alex@Alexs-MacBook-Pro src % javac Application.java
alex@Alexs-MacBook-Pro src % java Application
1.454268292682927
Please enter the result of: 477 / 328 = 
```

Now you can complete all 7 assignments and at the end you should get something like this:

```finished
Calculation 1: 
  477 / 328 = 12,00 
  Correct: false 
  Time needed: 303,21 sec

Calculation 2: 
  363 + 363 = 12,00 
  Correct: false 
  Time needed: 0,48 sec

Calculation 3: 
  426 + 467 = 12,00 
  Correct: false 
  Time needed: 0,44 sec

Calculation 4: 
  413 + 82 = 12,00 
  Correct: false 
  Time needed: 0,41 sec

Calculation 5: 
  112 - 312 = 12,00 
  Correct: false 
  Time needed: 0,42 sec

Calculation 6: 
  403 + 103 = 12,00 
  Correct: false 
  Time needed: 0,48 sec

Calculation 7: 
  27 - 322 = 12,00 
  Correct: false 
  Time needed: 0,53 sec

Average time needed: 43,71 sec
```

## How does it work?

In this math game, you will be presented with a series of assignments consisting of a number followed by an operator and another number, and your goal is to provide the correct answer.

### Rules

- The first number (num1) can range from -100 to 500.
- The operator can be one of four options: +, -, *, or /.
- The second number (num2) can also range from -100 to 500.
- If you enter an answer it is saved, you can not change it.
- The time needed for the answer is always tracked.

### Why Play?

This game is a great way to improve your mental math skills and speed, while also having fun. You can challenge yourself by trying to beat your high score.

Plus, it's a great way to pass the time and stay entertained while waiting in line, commuting, or just taking a break. So give it a try and see how far you can go!
